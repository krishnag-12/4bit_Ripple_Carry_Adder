# 4bit_Ripple_Carry_Adder
# Full Adder Module:

This module implements a full adder, a fundamental building block in digital circuits.

Inputs:

a: A single-bit input.
b: A single-bit input.
c_in: Carry-in input.
Outputs:

sum: The sum of the three inputs.
c_out: The carry-out output.
Logic Implementation:

The sum output is calculated using the XOR operation of the three inputs.
The c_out output is calculated using a combination of AND and OR operations to determine the carry-out condition.
# Ripple Carry Adder Module:

This module implements a 4-bit ripple carry adder using multiple full adder modules.

Inputs:

A[3:0]: A 4-bit input.
B[3:0]: A 4-bit input.
Outputs:

Sum[3:0]: The 4-bit sum output.
C_out: The final carry-out output.
Logic Implementation:

The module instantiates four full adder modules, one for each bit position.
The carry-out of each full adder is connected to the carry-in of the next higher-order full adder.
The initial carry-in (C[0]) is set to 0.
# How it Works:

The least significant bits (LSBs) of A and B are fed into the first full adder.
The sum and carry-out from the first full adder are calculated.
The carry-out from the first full adder is fed into the carry-in of the second full adder, along with the second bits of A and B.
This process continues for all four bits, with the final carry-out becoming the overall C_out.
# Key Points:

The ripple carry adder is a simple and intuitive design, but it can suffer from propagation delay issues, especially for larger bit widths.
For higher performance, carry-lookahead adders or other advanced techniques can be used.
The full adder is a fundamental building block in many digital circuits, including arithmetic logic units (ALUs), processors, and other digital systems.
